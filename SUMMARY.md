**KITTI Object Detection** is a dataset for an object detection task. It is used in the automotive industry. 

The dataset consists of 14999 images with 51865 labeled objects belonging to 9 different classes including *car*, *dont care*, *van*, and other: *pedestrian*, *cyclist*, *truck*, *misc*, *tram*, and *person sitting*.

Images in the KITTI Object Detection dataset have bounding box annotations. There are 7518 (50% of the total) unlabeled images (i.e. without annotations). There are 2 splits in the dataset: *test* (7518 images) and *train* (7481 images). The dataset was released in 2012 by the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology, Germany, Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems, Germany, and Toyota Technological Institute at Chicago, USA.

Here are the visualized examples for the classes:
